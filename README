Barebones Framework v1.8
The quick and dirty way to build static html websites in no time flat.



// What it is

BBF is a copy of the extremely excellent HTML5 Boilerplate by Paul Irish (http://html5boilerplate.com/) fitted with a helpful PHP script that allows you to create static html websites with ease.



// Usage

1. Drop the files on your webserver anywhere (that has PHP and mod_rewrite)
2. Rename 'default.htaccess' to simply '.htaccess'
3. Set the values in config.php to the ones appropriate for your website
4. Modify the file header and footer in inc/layout/header.php and inc/layout/footer.php
5. Add your own css to css/style.css
6. Profit!
